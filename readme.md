    It also provides _Search_ feature.

    * Contact Page: which shows information like
    address of shop, phone number, email addresses, static location map, etc

2. **Admin Part**: This part is developed for the shop owner(s) only, which can only be accessed using login credentials. This consists of following panels:
    * Customer Panel: Here admin can store information related to which customer accessed what service, customer details, etc.
    It provides features like _Create, Update, Delete, Search_ Customer Records.

        * Manage/Manipulate services post to be shown on _Home Page_.
        * Manage/Manipulate _Customer Record_.
        * _Add/Remove/Update_ available services and their categories.
